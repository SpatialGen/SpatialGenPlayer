### SpatialGen Player

This is a spatial video player the visionOS community can leverage to build their own experiences and to standardize spatial video display techniques. 

The player was initally developed by the [SpatialGen](https://spatialgen.ai) team and [Mike Swanson](https://blog.mikeswanson.com/). We forsee light maintainment of this repository so the community has better ways to display spatial videos.
